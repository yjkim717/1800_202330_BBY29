# CSS

Each CSS file corresponds to a page or component. 
global.css contains attributes that apply universally.

## Rules
1. Put common attributes in global
2. USE ID for specific attributes
3. Follow the color palette

## TODO

**CSS:**
- Organize css attributes into appropriate media queries

**HTML:**
- Implement the "Team" button on navbar

## List of Bugs
- Navbar is underneath the card in index.html (change z-index)
- Footer is not sticky on map.html
